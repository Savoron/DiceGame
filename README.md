#Lucky or Die!

Lucky or Die! is a simple turn based game. It's based of random chance rolling dice. Each stat is determined by two dice. One rolls to determine which of the other dice to roll for that stat. Hence why this is a lucky or die game. It's all down to the chance of your dice.

##Plans To Come:
I'm rewriting the engine of the game. So there will be a big jump from version 1 to version 2.
Things I have planned

 - New player/enemy base class
 - Defense added to player and enemy
 - UI redesign

 There's a lot that will be going on in this update. Hopefully I can get it done within the next week.
